            A modern wristwatch featuring solar charging and Bluetooth capabilities
            A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps, or any other kind of bracelet. A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain.
            
            Watches appeared in the 16th century. During most of its history, the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. These are called mechanical watches.[1][2] In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal.<img src="assets\images\smart-watch-white-background_1268-98.avif"alt="ijfuignndzvndgb"width="350"height="350"> By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch. Historically, this is called the quartz revolution (also known as the quartz crisis in Switzerland).[3][4] Developments in the 2010s include smart watches, which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist. They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities.<img src="assets\images\smart-watch-with-time-4-00-screen_999340-77230.avif"alt="K.A brand"width="350"height="350">

            In general, modern watches often display the day, date, month, and year. For mechanical watches, various extra features called "complications", such as moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon, are sometimes included. Most electronic quartz watches, on the other hand, include time-related features such as timers, chronographs, and alarm functions.<img src="assets\images\images (8).jpeg"width=""height="350"> Furthermore, some modern watches (like smart watches) even incorporate calculators, GPS[5] and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some of them use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time.<img src="assets\images\StockCake-E-Commerce Innovation Concept_1721649758.jpg"alt="K.A BBB WWW"width="350"height="350">
            
            Most watches that are used mainly for timekeeping have quartz movements. However, expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, despite being less accurate and more expensive than their electronic counterparts.[3][4][6] As of 2018, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction was the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, the world's most complicated mechanical watch until 1989, fetching US$24 million (CHF 23,237,000) in Geneva on 11 November 2014.[7][8][9][10][11] As of December 2019, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction (and wristwatch) was the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010, fetching US$31.19 million (CHF 31,000,000) in Geneva on 9 November 2019.[12]</p>

            <p>A watch can have hundreds to thousands of parts. Sounds exhausting or intimidating? I got you, friends. The first time I took interest in wristwatches, the feeling of overwhelm was no joke. There’s a huge number of parts of a wristwatch that I’ve never heard of.

                If you’re here, then you want to dig a little deeper about a watch, right? Maybe you want to service your watch’s broken yet unfamiliar parts, or talk to a friend who is an avid fan, or just learn a thing or two about a watch. Regardless of the purpose, you’re always welcome to the club.
                
                Moving on, let’s take a look at the basic nine parts of a wristwatch every beginner needs to know.
                
                1. The foundation of a watch – case
                The case is the outer part of a watch that protects the inner workings and maintains a watch’s basic shape. As the foundation of parts of a wristwatch, a case should be solid. It can be made from malleable materials; chemical elements, ceramics, and plastics. A high-end watch usually uses excellent chemical elements or metals such as stainless steel, bronze, gold, titanium, tantalum, and platinum. Each material has its pros and cons. For example, a ceramic case is extremely resistant to scratch, corrosion, and fading. Yet, it’s prone to shatter if it hits a hard surface.
                
                Also, the case comes in different shapes (any possible type of shape). The most common ones are round and square. However, there are watch brands that produce a watch’s case in a triangle, rectangle, hexagon, tonneau, and many more. You name it.</p>

                    As you know, certain things are important to us on a daily basis; these things are those we ingest into our body (food) or those we wear on our body (clothes, watches and shoes).
                    
                     
                    
                    Although, some people may say otherwise; but in this article, I will share with you the importance of wrist watch and its benefits in our daily lives. So, whether you are looking to buy a wrist watch as a gift for someone special ; or for personal use, this post will guide you through the main benefits of wrist watches.

                    Have you ever asked yourself the question of who invented wrist watch?
                    
                    History made it clear to us that the first wristwatch was made in 1868 by Swiss watch manufacturer called Patek Philippe.
                    
                    Furthermore, this first timepiece was made for a lady called Countess Koscowicz of Hungary; as a piece of decorative (fashion) jewellery for use on the wrist as a timekeeping device.
                    
                    Before diving into the reasons why this timepiece device is important in our daily lives, let me inform you that this article will also look into the following.</p>

                    <p>Buying pre-owned watches is a great way to get a luxury brand, such as Rolex or Omega watches, for a lower price.

                        Find vintage and exclusive models
                        For serious horology enthusiasts, vintage and limited edition models are difficult to get new, so the secondhand market is a feasible alternative to track down specific pieces. If you’re looking for an investment piece, pre-owned could be the way to go.
                        
                        Made to last
                        Luxury watches are a testament to the expert craftsmen who built them. They are created to stand the test of time and become a piece you can pass down the generations. Even pre-owned, high-quality watches have plenty of life left, making it a purchase you can enjoy for decades to come.
